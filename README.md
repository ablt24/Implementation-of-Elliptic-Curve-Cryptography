# Implementation-of-Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) secures digital communication using elliptic curves over finite fields. It offers strong security with smaller keys than RSA, reducing computation, bandwidth, and storage. ECC powers protocols like ECDSA for digital signatures and ECDH for key exchange, making it ideal for IoT, blockchain, and modern cybersecurity.
